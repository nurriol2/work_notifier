# I can specify the crontab to only send out a schedule Sunday through Friday.
# There is no need to run the script on Saturdays because we are not open *the next day*
# Normally, we get the following day's schedule at around 1900. I will copy that behavior here
# This crontab says 
# at 19:00, on every day of the month, any month of the year, from Sunday to Friday...
# move to the project directory
# and execute `main.py` with the python3 interpreter
